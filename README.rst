:Henry:   Look! It's moving. It's sha — it's... it's alive.
          It's alive... It's alive, it's moving, it's alive!
          It's alive, it's alive, it's alive! It's ALIVE!
:Victor:  Henry — in the name of God!
:Henry:   Oh in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!

Motivation
==========

When debugging across multiple log files, much switching back and forth between
them may be required, with visual comparison of time stamps to discern the
correct sequence of logged events.

This project aims to simplify this process by stitching together a unified
timeline from the parts of various log files.
